            Welcome to Lu.Store, your ultimate destination for premium K-pop themed merchandise! Founded in 2020 by a
            passionate K-pop fan, our shop has grown from a small Instagram page to a beloved brand within the K-pop
            community.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Lu.Store began as a creative outlet during the pandemic when our founder, Lucy, combined her love for K-pop
            with her artistic talents. What started as creating custom stickers for friends quickly evolved into a
            full-fledged business as demand grew for her unique designs that captured the essence of K-pop culture.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, we're proud to offer a wide range of products including stickers, posters, and lomo cards featuring
            your favorite K-pop groups and members. Each item is thoughtfully designed with attention to detail and
            printed on high-quality materials.
